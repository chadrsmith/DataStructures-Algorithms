* Program:
*    Assignment 05, Go Fish
*    Brother Ercanbrack, CS 235
* Author:
*    Chad Smith
* Summary: 
*    This is all the functions necessary to play Go Fish!
*
*    Estimated:  10.0 hrs
*    Actual:     12.0 hrs
*      I was having difficulty in the insert operator, I kept getting
*      a seg fault in my insert operator when I would shift an element
*      in the middle of the Set. I added a few delete statements to the
*      pointer data. It seemed to be working good in Xcode. However, in
*      the Linux lab it isn't working. Can't quite put my finger on what
*      is going on.
