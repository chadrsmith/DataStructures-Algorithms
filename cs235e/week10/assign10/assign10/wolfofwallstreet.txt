The world of investing can be a
jungle. WE SEE a charging, snorting BULL.
Bulls. WE SEE a ferocious, growling BEAR.
Bears.   Danger at every turn.
That's why we at Stratton Oakmont
pride ourselves on being the best.
portfolio with a wealthy older COUPLE; a smiling young
Trained professionals to guide you
through the financial wilderness.
Stratton Oakmont. Stabilty.
Integrity. Pride.
Absolute bedlam. 300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their
early 20s, chant wildly as JORDAN BELFORT, handsome, 30,
stands beside a DWARF dressed in tights, cape & helmet.
Twenty five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bullseye!
Watch and learn, people!
The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his
pants and collar. In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets
are made. Jordan winds up, aims for the "dartboard".
One.   Two.      Throw!!
The Brokers cheer, and as the screaming Dwarf takes
flight, hurtling toward camera, we FREEZE FRAME:
My name is Jordan Belfort. No, not
him, me. I'm a former member of
the middle class raised by two
accountants in a tiny apartment in
Bayside, Queens.
The year I turned 26, I made 49
million dollars as the head of
my own brokerage firm
which really pissed me off
because it was three shy of a
million a week.
Hey, my Ferrari was white, like
Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.
See that humongous estate down
there? That's my house.
My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay
Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model
and Miller Lite girl.
Yeah, she was the one blowing me
in the Ferrari, so put your dick
back in your pants.
In addition to Naomi and my two
perfect kids, I own a mansion,
private jet, six cars, three
horses, two vacation homes and
a 170 foot yacht.
I also gamble like a degenerate,
drink like a fish, fuck hookers
maybe five times a week and have
three different Federal agencies
looking to indict me.
Oh yeah, and I love drugs.
Pull up!   Jesus! We're gonna
crash!!
Jordan's head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.
The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering
30 feet above a huge mansion. Down below, through
Jordan's hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling
pool, tennis court and waterfall.
Check this out despite my
completely fucked up state, I
could fly straight while still
seeing two of everything.
He closes one eye; his POV sharpens. Putting pressure on
the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the
driving range... then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground.
Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay,
buddy.
Morning. Sober now, impeccable in suit and tie, Jordan
heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice.
I take Quaaludes for my back,
fifteen to twenty a day.
But of all the drugs under God's
blue heaven, there's one that's my
absolute favorite.
Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With
the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses
a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. As he
peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:
Enough of this shit'll make you
invincible, able to conquer the
world and eviscerate your enemies.
He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.
I'm not talking about this. I'm
talking about this.
(Jordan unfurls the
$100 with a SNAP)
Money is the oxygen of capitalism
and I wanna breathe more than any
other human being alive.
Money doesn't just buy you a
better life better food, better
cars, better pussy it also
makes you a better person. You
can give generously to the church
of your choice or the political
party. You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.
His 300 BROKERS, mostly young men with their jackets off,
scream wildly. They worship him.
I headed to the only place that
befit my high-minded ambitions...
Jordan emerges, kisses TERESA goodbye, then joins a sea
of Commuters heading to work.
JERRY FOGEL (PRE-LAP)
You are lower than fucking pond
scum.
You got a problem with that?
(reads name tag)
Jordan?
Your job is `connector', which
means you'll be dialing the phone
over 500 times a day, trying to
`connect' me with business owners.
And till you pass your Series 7,
that's all you'll be doing. Sit.
Just so you know, last year I made
over 300k and the other guy you'll
be working for made a million.
A million dollars? I could only
imagine what a douchebag that guy
must be.
A manicured hand lands on Jordan's shoulder. It's MARK
HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.
Good, you've met Jerry. One of
the smartest guys in the office.
Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out
of loneliness.
Fogel's smile turns to a frown.      He hands Jordan a stack
of 3x5 index cards.
Smile and dial. And don't pick
your fucking head up till one.
Don't mind Jerry, his father raped
him as a child. Besides, I'm
senior broker here, he's a
worthless piker. I heard you
pitched stock at your job
interview.
Had to do something to stand out.
I fuckin' love that! Let's grab
lunch later. Windows good with
you?
Great.   Yeah.
Let's fuck!!
Miniscribe's a fuckin' steal!
Thirty eight bucks a share!
Your broker in West Virginia?
What are you buying, a coal mine?
It's the 80s, the game is high-
tech.
Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!
You want to know what money sounds
like? Visit a trading floor on
Wall Street. Fuck this, shit
that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I
couldn't believe how these guys
talked to each other
Dial the cocksucking phone!
I was hooked within seconds.
It was like mainlining adrenaline.
The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we're suddenly
Got enough for one more? Tootski?
No.   Thanks though.
Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the
tuxedoed Maitre'D, approaches.
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
you on this glorious afternoon?
Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan
notices.
Here's the game plan, Hector.
Bring us two Absolut Martinis
straight up. Precisely seven and
a half minutes after you deliver
those you'll bring two more, then
two more every five minutes until
one of us passes out.
An excellent strategy, sir.
Actually, I'm good with 7-Up.
Jordan might as well have farted at the table.
First day on Wall Street, Hector.
Give him time.
(Hector offers menus)
No thanks, I'm not eating.
Hector heads off.
You can get high during the day
and still function?
High is the only way to do this
fucking job. Guy who coined the
term "three-martini lunch" was a
woman. Cocaine and hookers, my
friend, the keys to success.
I gotta say, I'm really excited
about being part of your team.
I wanna do all I can for our
clients and
(reciting an ad)
"Here at L.F. Rothschild, our
clients aren't just important,
they're family." Just as long as
we get our taste first. Remember
something, Jordan, your top
priority in this job: make us
money. If the clients get rich
along the way, bully for them.
Got a girlfriend?
Wife.   She cuts hair.
Mark swallows a comment about that.      Gets to business.
OK, first rule of Wall Street.
Nobody -- and I don't care if
you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy
Buffet -- nobody knows if a
stock's going up, down or fucking
sideways, least of all stock
brokers. But we have to pretend
we know. Make sure you stay
relaxed. Nobody wants to buy
something from someone who sounds
like they haven't gotten laid in a
month. Take breaks when you feel
stressed, jerk off if you can.
You like jerking off, right?
Well... sure.
Good, jerking off is key. And I
highly recommend cocaine, which
will make you dial faster, which
is good for me. Churn `em and
burn `em, baby.
For the next six months I learned
the ways of Wall Street.
My first day as a stockbroker, a
future Master of the Universe.
They called it Black Monday.
By four p.m. the market was down
508 points, the biggest one-day
drop since the crash of `29.
Holy. Fucking. Shit.
So I'll take an extra shift, don't
worry about it.
You work too much as it is.
We could pawn my engagement ring.
We're not pawning anything. I'm
gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.
You know that doesn't matter,
right?
He smiles, kisses her.
"Nobody Beats the Wiz". I could
be a stock boy.
You're a stock broker.
No one's hiring brokers right now,
sweetie.
This place is.
The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture
and a dozen misfit "BROKERS" giving loud, obnoxious sales
pitches. Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people.
DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.
I'm looking for Investor's Center?
That's us, hey. Dwayne.
(as they shake hands)
Jordan Belfort, I called earlier.
I was a broker with Rothschild.
Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in
ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.
I'm tellin' you, this stock is
goin' up!... Cause I know,
okay?!... I have inside
information!
Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he's hearing.
Where are your quotrons?
No quotrons, we sell off the pink
sheets penny stocks.
Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are
literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:
Company don't have enough capital
to be listed on NASDAQ, their
shares trade here.
(points to the book)
Like these guys, Aerotyne? They
make radar detectors out of a
garage in Dubuque.
Six cents a share? Who buys this
crap?
Schmucks mostly. Mailmen,
plumbers, people thinking they can
get rich quick. They answer our
ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
The spread on these is huge.
So's your commission, that's the
point. Blue chips stocks you get
what, one percent? Pink sheets
are fifty.
Wait a second. You're telling me
if I sell two thousand dollars
worth of stock, my commission is a
thousand bucks?
Technically, yeah, but not even
the biggest schmuck buys two
thousand dollars of this shit.
(into phone)
Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan
Belfort with Investor's Center in
New York City. You recently
responded to one of our ads...
The reason I'm calling is that
an extremely exciting investment
opportunity crossed my desk today.
Typically our firm recommends no
more than five stocks per year:
this is one of them...
Aerotyne International is a
cutting edge tech firm out of the
Midwest, awaiting imminent patent
approval on a new generation of
radar equipment...
so if Aerotyne's shares rise
to only a dollar and our
research indicates they could go
much, much higher your profit
on a mere three thousand dollar
investment would be upwards of
fifty thousand... That's right,
you could pay off your mortgage.
Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:
Four thousand dollars, will
that be check or money order?...
Thank you, sir.
Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a "buy" ticket.
Just like that I made two grand.
The other guys looked at me like
I'd just discovered fire.
How'd you fuckin' do that?
Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.
It's a rock-solid company, sir,
it's the next Microsoft...
Six thousand. Terrific.
Though I knew I was selling
garbage, within twelve weeks I
was making a fortune.
And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...
And as a wise man once told me,
my only responsibility was to
put meat on the table.
Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the Wall
Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food. DONNIE
AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright
white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.
That your Jag in the lot?
Yeah.
Nice ride. Donnie Azoff.
Jordan Belfort.
I've seen it around. We live in
the same building. Twelfth floor?
(Jordan nods)
What do you do, bro?
Stock broker.
Kids furniture, me and my brother-
in-law. Making any money?
Seventy grand last month.
Get the fuck out. You made
seventy grand in one month.
Seventy two actually.
Donnie studies him, isn't sure if he's full of shit.
Tell you what. You show me a pay
stub with $72,000 on it, I'm
quitting my job right now and
coming to work with you.
And he did quit his job, which
I thought was a little weird.
I mean I had just met this
fucking guy.
A few beats, then into phone:
Yo Paulie, it's Donnie... Yeah,
listen, I quit.
There were other things about him
too, like his phosphorescent white
teeth and the fact that he wore
horn rims with clear lenses to
look more Waspy. He also married
his first cousin
No problem, if we have a kid who's
a retard, we'll just leave it on
the steps of some institution.
He was also a closet drug fiend.
I'd known him less than a week
before he talked me into smoking
crack.
You now, take a hit!
Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it.
Omigod, I fuckin' love you!!
I knew I had to make him my
partner.
Jordan looks on as Donnie works the phone like a madman.
Which turned out to be a great
move - Donnie was a fast learner
who transitioned into the penny
stock business quickly.
Jordan and Donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop,
which has a "For Lease" sign in the window.
So within months we started our
own firm out of an abandoned auto
body shop.
In addition to Donnie, I also
recruited my friends Sea Otter,
Chester and Robbie, who were at
the time all middling pot dealers.
--see everyone wants to get rich,
so you're already half way there
by the time the call starts.
I sold weed once to this Amish
dude, had one of those beards with
no mustache?
So?
He only wanted to make furniture.
What's that got to do with
anything?
He just said everyone wants to
get rich.
That's true, you did.
Buddhists too, they don't give a
shit about money either.
Man I could sell weed to anybody,
get a convent full of nuns fucking
wasted.
We see the above guys working the phones.
Brad, the guy I really wanted,
took a pass, since he'd become the
Quaalude king of Bayside.
Bare-chested, wearing kung fu pants, Brad sells ludes to
a couple of HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.
They were absolute morons, my
friends, but like I always said
Jordan emerges from his office into the garage area
(the bullpen), looking on as Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Sea
Otter and four other BROKERS (now including RUGRAT and
Toby) make sales calls from the cheap desks.
Give me them young, hungry and
stupid and in no time I'll make
them rich.
On lounge chairs at the edge of a dock, bottle of wine
nearby, Jordan sits with Teresa. He smiles as she opens
a jewelry case -- inside is a diamond tennis bracelet.
Then what?
They sit in silence.
I don't know, it's just -- these
stocks, these crappy companies.
In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate.
Why can't you be legitimate now?
It's not illegal, Teresa,
technically. I mean they're real
stocks, they're just...
Never gonna make anybody money.
Wouldn't you feel better selling
this junk to rich people, who can
afford to lose the money at least?
Rich people don't buy penny
stocks.
Why not?
Because they're too smart, that's
why not.
I mean what person of any
substance would trust this bunch
of jerk-offs? Like the Pinhead,
Toby Welch. I mean, look at this
fucking Cro-Magnon, I wouldn't
trust him to pick up a rock.
Toby Welch. I mean, look at this
fucking Cro-Magnon, he couldn't
even think without moving his
lips.
Or Nicky Koskoff, who I called
Rugrat because--
Well, you can probably figure that
out for yourself.
But what if they didn't sound like
jerk-offs? What if I took this
bunch of nincompoops and molded
them in my own image? I
reinvented the company, gave it a
new image, a new name. Something
patrician, blue-blooded, something
that reeked of tradition and anti-
semitism.
Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton
Oakmont.   The clients we've gone
after in the past -- they're done.
We will now target exclusively the
wealthiest one percent of
Americans. The methods we've used
-- over. Loud, obnoxious sales
hype is worthless with these
people.
In military terms it's like carpet-
bombing -- noisy, menacing and
only marginally effective. As
Stratton brokers you will be laser-
guided smart-bombs aimed at high-
priority targets. You will
establish an initial relationship
with your clients selling only
blue chip stocks -- then and only
then will you attempt to sell the
pink sheets, where the real money
is. Now the key to every sale is
this:
No one buys stock unless he thinks
it's going up and going up now.
You must convince your client to
buy before the takeover happens,
before the lawsuit is settled,
before the patent is granted.
If he says I'll think about it and
call you back, it's over, you're
dead! No one calls back! So you
have to create urgency
Another day. With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in
the b.g., Jordan is on speakerphone with a potential
CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.
--and once Kodak settles the
lawsuit, institutions will be
permitted to buy their shares in
large blocks again. And when that
happens, which is any day now,
what do you think will happen to
the price of Kodak stock?
It'll go up?
Exactly. Which is why you should
pick up 5000 shares today, a
$200,000 investment.
Then you lower your voice.
Believe me, sir, you will not be
sorry.
Then you wait. Whoever speaks
first loses. At this point, where
are we in the sale? Chester?
About to close?
No, you sweet and sour douchebag!
We're at the beginning of the
beginning! This is where the sale
starts. You as a salesman are
almost hoping he says no so you
can finally do your fucking job!
I don't know, I don't think so.
He doesn't know, he needs to
think, he's gotta ask his wife!
The fact is it doesn't matter what
the fuck he says! If he's already
agreed that the stock's going up,
then the only real objection he
has at this point is he doesn't
trust you! And he shouldn't trust
you, you're a fucking salesman!
So what do you say?
Donnie talks on the phone to a Client.
Let me ask you this, sir -- had I
been your broker for the past
three to four years and made you
money on a consistent basis, you
probably wouldn't say you need to
think about it, you'd probably say
pick me up three or four thousand
shares, am I right?
I'd like to read you something.
Month end, March 1991! $28.7
million in gross commissions all
in Stratton issues. Not bad for
penny stocks, huh boys? Not bad
for dumpin' penny stocks.
The place goes WILD with applause.
And to celebrate with a weekly act
of debauchery, I have offered our
lovely sales assistant Danielle
Harrison ten thousand dollars to
have her head shaved!
Jordan motions to DANIELLE HARRISON, 19, pretty, sitting
in a chair nearby. Behind her, Rugrat uses clippers to
shave her thick brown mane. The place goes nuts.
FYI, Danielle tells me she's using
the money for breast implants! Is
this a great company or what?!!
More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen
to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of "Stars &
Stripes Forever" as he opens the door to a
Word spread throughout Wall
Street -- I was becoming a legend.
Forbes Magazine even called to do
a profile on me...
A total fucking hatchet job.
That conniving little twat!
"Jordan Belfort, a twisted version
of Robin Hood who takes from the
rich and gives to himself and his
merry band of brokers".
There's no such thing as bad
publicity, sweetie.
The hell's all this?
The Forbes article. They're
applying for jobs.
They spot Jordan, start clamoring, waving their resumes.
Mr. Belfort! Over here! Sir!
Forbes had made me a superstar.
Every day dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door with
resumes they hadn't even bothered
to spellcheck.
If we hired `em, they dropped out
of college overnight and blew
whatever allowance they had on a
new suit from our in-house tailor.
The median age of our brokerage
couldn't get served in the bar
down the street.
Not this guy though -- what the
fuck is he even doing here? He
read the Forbes article, too, but
he already had a job.
Within months, we doubled in size,
moved to even bigger offices.
It was a madhouse, a greed-fest,
with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone and body fluids.
I had to declare the office a fuck-
free zone between the hours of 9
and 7, but even that didn't help.
Taped to the mirror we see a MEMO inside a red circle,
two anatomically correct stick figures fuck doggy-style,
a red line slashing through them.
Actually the madness started on
our very first day, when one of
our brokers, Ben Jenner,
christened the elevator by
getting a blowjob from a sales
assistant.
Two dozen Brokers cheer, watching through the rising
glass elevator as BEN JENNER, 25, gets a blowjob from a
brunette SALES ASSISTANT.
Her name was Pam and   to her
credit, she did have   an amazing
technique, with this   wild twist
and jerk motion. Eventually Ben married her, which
was pretty amazing considering she
blew every guy in the office.
He got depressed and killed
himself three years later.
A crime scene photo; Ben in his underwear, dead on a
bathroom floor, a gun near his head, which oozes blood.
Anyway, in an attempt to maintain
order, I hired my dad Max as
defacto CFO and head of the
Gestapo.
We called him Mad Max because of
his hair-trigger temper, which
could be set off by something as
innocuous as a ringing telephone.
The phone RINGS.
MAX
Who the hell has the goddamn gall
to call this house on a Tuesday
evening! Goddammit!
But then the weirdest thing would
happen. Though he'd never been
near England, he'd pick up the
phone and affect an ever-so-slight
British accent.
Greatly agitated, Max stomps toward the phone.
This was his other persona -- the
super polite, ever-gracious Sir
Max.
Hello?... Yes, Gene, right-eo.
Good-good then... Cheerio.
It was absolutely bizarre. He'd
hang up...
(hangs up phone)
Goddamn fucking halfwit!
What if he gets hurt?
He'll be wearing a helmet. Plus
they've got, like, superhuman
strength anyway.
I did hear you're not supposed to
make direct eye contact. If you
look at them too long in their
I think there's a limit to how far
we can go... I mean we can throw
shit at him and
They have a lot of feelings.
There's a specific thing that
they'll do - You can throw him at
a dart board but if you want him
to show his cock or
Yes, that's what this guy does.
That's his gift.
Can we also bowl with him?
His brother is actually the
bowler.
They strap a skateboard to him and
throw him down an alley.
They're ornery, too, the little
pricks. You gotta be careful.
Get some tranq darts.
A little straitjacket.
What's the liability on something
like this?
That's a whole different thing. I
can get on the phone with some
people. I can talk to the
insurance company and tell them
exactly what we're going to do.
But I think we go back to the same
plan - loophole - if we don't
really consider them people I
think we are in the clear.
I think we should keep one in the
office because I think they're
good luck.
Treat it like the fuckin' thing it
is. He's coming in. We're paying
him for something. Treat him with
respect. And you just shake his
hand like you don't even think
anything's wrong.
You just look like something else
is going on.
You don't look at his eyes.
Say "thank you for being here".
You don't turn your back on him.
It's a sign of disrespect.
If you want a cracker or something
- I'm gonna have some treats in my
pocket. I want to be in a strip
club with you guys. Literally pull
out a brief case and have a little
fuckin' guy pop out of there. You
know how much fuckin' pussy you
get?
The point is get it out.
Get the jokes out now. Get the
fuckin' jokes out now.
You're gonna fuck it up. Purge all
this shit right now.
That's what I'm saying

$26,000 for one dinner!!

Donnie ordered sides.

DONNIE
Yeah, that was... Sorry.

MAX

What is EJ Entertainment?     What is
EJ Entertainment?!

JORDAN
(restraining a grin)
You tell me, Dad.

MAX
It's a goddamn prostitution ring
is what it is!!

Jordan feigns shock, turns to Donnie: did you know it was
a prostitution ring?!

DONNIE
Doesn't the IRS allow for T&A?

MAX
It's T&E and stop fucking with me!
What kind of hookers take credit
cards, anyway?!

Jordan takes the bill, starts flipping through it.

JORDAN (V.O.)
In Stratton parlance, there were
three kinds of hookers. There
were blue chips, the top of the
line. Model material. They were
priced between $300 and $500 and
made you wear a condom unless you
gave them a hefty tip, which I
always did.

pretty, but not great, usually
in the two to three hundred
dollar range.

Max continues to steam so Jordan ushers Robbie, Rugrat
and Donnie out the door.

JORDAN
Give us a minute, will you, guys?

He closes the door, then stretches a bit, exaggeratedly,
letting out a little moan.

MAX
What's the matter?

JORDAN
Nothing, just... My back's been
killing me. Pain shooting down my
leg. Not to worry, it'll pass.

MAX
What do the doctors say?

JORDAN
Doctors, what do they know? I'm on
like twenty different medications.

JORDAN                                 *
I could afford to pay them more,                     *
but then they wouldn't need me as                    *
much. And as long as they need me                    *
they'll always fear me. I know it                    *

He turns and exits.    Jordan watches him go, thinking.

JORDAN (V.O.)
It was obscene -- in the normal
world. But who wanted to live
there?


78   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - DAY      (JUN `92)               78

Massive, with an Olympic-size pool overlooking the beach.
Dozens of luxury cars parked outside. On a balcony,
Jordan is mid-speech, in a bathing suit, addressing the
Strattonites below, Teresa at his side.

JORDAN (O.C.)
-- so enjoy yourselves, you all
deserve a celebration. `Cept for
Kimmie, she's lazy and she steals.                   *

As my friend Donnie Azoff says,
"If you wanna party with the boys,
you gotta wake up with the men."
Monday morning I want you all
looking razor-sharp. Cuz
Stratton's got a few things on the
horizon, things that're gonna take
it right up into the fucking
stratosphere!

The Crowd goes nuts. One Broker lets loose a wolf-howl,
and the crowd toasts Jordan, chanting his name.

CROWD
Jor-dan!   Jor-dan! Jor-dan!

As Jordan looks down smiling like a benevolent dictator --

JORDAN (PRE-LAP)

79   INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - (LATER THAT) DAY                79

GORGEOUS PEOPLE dance/drink/snort coke. Upstairs, Jordan
plays pool with Sea Otter, Donnie, Robbie, Toby and
Rugrat, assigning ludes with every pocketed ball.

JORDAN
Exactly. We do our own IPO's and
we will print money.

SEA OTTER
Eat like a bird, shit like an
elephant, baby!

JORDAN
They can take their Harvard asses
under our desks and suck our
cocks.
(to Rugrat)
How soon can you get the paperwork
filed?

RUGRAT

Can't we talk about this Monday?

JORDAN
It's a simple fucking question.

We've got Arncliffe National,
they're looking to go public,
we've got --

DONNIE
(very luded)
Oh, oh, Steve... Steve...

JORDAN
What?

DONNIE
...Steve... M-m-madden...

Donnie gesticulates wildly. The guys crack up. WE PUSH
IN ON Donnie, practically drooling, as Jordan gives us a
quick tutorial on ludes...

79A   QUAALUDE TUTORIAL                                              *79A

CUT TO: Extreme close up of guys doing drugs.                  *

JORDAN (V.O.)
The quaalude was first synthesized
in 1951 by an Indian doctor --
that's dot Indian, not feathers --
as a sedative, and was prescribed
to stressed housewives with sleep
disorders. Pretty soon someone
figured out that if you resisted
the urge to sleep for fifteen
minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass
high from it. Didn't take long
for people to start abusing ludes,
`course, and in 1982 the U.S.
Government Schedule One'd them,
along with the rest of the world.
Which meant there was only a
finite amount of these things
left. No shit, you can't even
find `em anymore today. You
people're all shit outta luck.

What're you saying, buddy?
(to the others)
Shhhh... listen to him...

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

DONNIE
Ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess...

Jordan suspects Donnie may actually be onto something.
But just then...

SEA OTTER
Holy fuck.

Jordan peers over the balcony where Sea Otter's looking.

NAOMI LAPAGLIA. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered
the party with her date BLAIR. She smiles, full lips
parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short
dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.

RUGRAT
My nutsack's about to explode.

ROBBIE                                *
Someone's gotta take that down.

There's no debate who that someone should be. Eyes
locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs.

WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to
things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.

NAOMI (V.O.)
A lotta people would look at me
and think: "golddigger, she's out
to land the richest husband she
can." But you see, I came from
nothing. Like, below the poverty
line. And when you come from
nothing, being rich means never
having to go back to that.

Jordan approaches CRISTY, 20s, one of his guests.

CRISTY
Jordan, hey.
(he smiles; Cristy
picks up his intent)
Have you met my friend Naomi?

Jordan takes Naomi's hand, doesn't let go.

JORDAN
Naomi.

NAOMI
You have an awesome house. I
don't think I've ever been in a
house like this.
43.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

JORDAN
You like it? I just got it. I
guess it's okay. Six bedrooms,
two hot-tubs, one off the master
suite overlooking the water. You
like to jet-ski?

Naomi's date Blair offers his hand to break them apart.
Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.

BLAIR
Hi.   Blair Hollingsworth.

Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi.

Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray
to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa's eyes follow hers
and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes.

JORDAN
You're telling me you've never jet-
ski'ed in your life?!

NAOMI
Never.

BLAIR
Y'know, we really should hit it,
there's two other parties we're
s'posed to get to --

JORDAN
What?    You just got here.   Stay.

Naomi looks like she'd like to.     Hildy approaches,
introduces herself, then:

HILDY
Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

JORDAN
With what?

HILDY
I dunno, you'll have to ask your
wife what she wants.

Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar.

DONNIE(O.S.)
Oh sweet Jesus!

Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking
off to Naomi. Hildy comes running over.
44.
The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

HILDY
Donnie!   What the fuck are you
doing?!

During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing
Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --

JORDAN (V.O.)
The day I met Naomi was the day I
truly became the Wolf. Every guy
wanted her -- so I had to have
her.

-- Jordan watches her go. Naomi shoots a glance back to
him and, like that, he's hooked.

82   INT. SIGN OF THE DOVE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT         (JUN `92)         82

Romantic; elegant. Over a bottle of `53 Lafite, Jordan
sits in mid conversation with Naomi, who is stunning in a
low-cut black cocktail dress.

JORDAN
Bay Ridge.      That's near Staten
Island?

NAOMI
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano
Bridge. Guinea gulch. Ever been?

JORDAN
You're Italian?

NAOMI
My dad's side. Also Dutch,
German, English -- I'm a mutt.
Actually I have family over there,
in London. My Aunt Emma.

JORDAN
That explains it then.

NAOMI
What?

JORDAN
(smiles)
You're a Duchess. The Duchess of
Bay Ridge.

Naomi smiles, flags a passing WAITER.

NAOMI
Could I have a straw please?

The Waiter nods, heads off.     A few beats, then:

NAOMI (CONT'D)
So I was a little surprised you
asked Cristy for my number.

JORDAN
How come?

NAOMI
Aren't you married?

JORDAN
Married people can't have friends?

Naomi smiles. The Waiter brings the straw. She opens
it, slips it in her red wine glass. Off Jordan's look:

NAOMI
So I don't stain my teeth.

And as she sips the wine seductively through the straw...


83   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT                                   83

Jordan's Ferrari makes its way over the bridge, heading
back toward Brooklyn.

NAOMI (O.S.)

camisoles, bustiers, panties.

Jordan glances over -- her dress is riding up her thigh.

JORDAN (V.O.)
She designs panties?! Jesus
fucking Christ!

Naomi smiles.

JORDAN
Sounds like something I might
invest in. Venture capital.

The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

NAOMI
Well we should definitely keep in
touch, then.

JORDAN
Absolutely.

He pulls over outside her brownstone.

NAOMI
That's me.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Think, Jordan, think! How can you
get up to her apartment?!

They look at each other.     We can almost hear Jordan's
heart pounding.

NAOMI
You wanna come up for some tea?


85   INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   85

A small, cozy apartment. Naomi enters, Jordan close
behind. She picks up Rocky, her yapping Maltese.

NAOMI
Say hi, Rocky.

Naomi waves Rocky's paw.     Jordan smiles.

NAOMI (CONT'D)
Why don't you light a fire? I'll
be right out.

Jordan nods, takes in her scent as she walks away.

JORDAN (V.O.)
God, please help me. How can I
fuck this girl?

As he crouches by the fireplace, his skypager vibrates.
He checks the readout: "Teresa". His face falls as he
hits the "silent" button, mind racing with guilt.

JORDAN (V.O.)
That's it, you're leaving. You're
going home to your wife.

Jordan stands, turns around -- NAOMI is in the doorway,
naked except for high heels.

JORDAN (V.O.)

For eleven seconds.

Jordan cums loudly, convulsively.

JORDAN
I'm sorry, I--

NAOMI
Did you cum?

JORDAN
(nods; gasping)
Yeah, but I'm still hard.

Jordan looks down at her.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Being inside her... was like your

And as they start fucking again...

89   INT. LIMOSINE - NIGHT (AUG `92)                                 89

Giggling like a child, Jordan pours coke from a vial,
creating a little mound atop one of Naomi's breasts.

JORDAN
Hold still, don't move.

Watch the potholes!
48.
The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

More giggling, then he snorts the coke off her breast,
burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her. Naomi
laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop. The
door opens from outside -- the Doorman?

TERESA (O.S.)
Get out of the fucking car.

Jordan looks up, locks eyes with Teresa. He jumps off
Naomi, stumbles out, closing the door behind himself.

she even hired a gay butler.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER, 40s, enters with hot towels on a

them out, I checked the apartment.

With Nicholas seated in a chair, Jordan sits across from

contorted, frothing with rage. Nearby, giant Chester
Ming sits quietly, saying nothing.

JORDAN
I just want my stuff back, okay?

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
I didn't take anything.

DONNIE
(in his face)
I should kill you, cocksucker!
You do not fuck with this man!

Jordan holds Donnie off.    Turns back to Nicholas.

JORDAN
You were high, things got out of
control, I get it. Believe me I
do, I have a Phd in debauchery.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
I didn't do it.

DONNIE
I'll knock your fuckin' teeth out,
motherfucker!

JORDAN
Just give me the money, give me
the jewelry, and we'll forget the
whole thing.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
It's because I'm gay, isn't it?

JORDAN
Nicholas. You could fuck a baby
sheep as far as I care, on my
brand new fucking sofa. What I
won't stand for is being robbed.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
I'm telling you the truth.

JORDAN
I'll ask you one last time.

DONNIE
You're dead, you piece of shit!

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
Jordan, please.

JORDAN
Fine.

Jordan nods to Chester. Without a word, he crosses to
Nicholas and BAMMM!! Nicholas's nose splits open like a
ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere. Tough-guy Donnie
takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail.
And as Chester pummels Nicholas's face into chopped
meat...

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It's amazing the kind of loyalty
money will buy. I mean Chester
almost killed this prick.

Chester starts to hang Nicholas over the balcony by his
legs. Jordan stops him.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I finally called the cops, mainly
to save Nicholas's life.


98   INT. JORDAN'S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY                98

With the bloodied Nicholas in the background, Jordan
talks to two NYPD COPS, handing them each a wad of cash.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I gave them each a thousand bucks
and told them what Nicholas had
done. Then they kicked his ass.

As the Cops swat Nicholas with their nightsticks:

Fuckin' thief, huh?              Piece of shit.

98A   EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY (OCT `92)                               98A

As Jordan golfs with Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Toby and         *
some hookers, Brad pulls up in a golf cart with a cash-        *
filled gym bag.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Besides Brad, I had eight other
`ratholes', close friends who'd
own stock on paper, but kick the
profits back to me after I drove
the price through the roof.

They hug, then Jordan adds the gym bag to several others
on the back of his golf cart. Donnie tries to befriend
Brad; Brad isn't interested.

JORDAN (V.O.)
The SEC knew I was doing something

101   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - (ANOTHER) DAY            101

Jordan, Max and securities lawyer MANNY RISKIN exit the
kitchen with coffees.

MANNY RISKIN
I'm telling you -- piss on the
SEC's leg, you'll end up with your
tits in a ringer.

FREEZE FRAME - Manny stuffs a cruller into his mouth.

JORDAN (V.O.)
My securities attorney, Manny
Riskin. Seven hundred an hour to                    *
be the voice of doom.

BACK TO SCENE

JORDAN
It's under control. Will you
relax already?

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Just then, Max spots a BROKER break-dancing as three
other Brokers look on...

MAX
What the fuck is this imbecile
doing?!

Max crosses off, starts screaming at the break-dancing
Broker. Jordan keeps walking with Manny.

JORDAN (V.O.)
The SEC sent two lawyers down to
review our files, so I set them
up in our conference room.

Jordan passes the conference room, looks in the window--
two SEC ATTORNEYS wear coats as they review documents.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Then I had it bugged and the air
conditioning locked till it felt
like Antarctica in there.

One of the SEC Attorneys blows into his hands for warmth.
Manny follows Jordan toward the bullpen, his frenzied
Brokers working the phones.

JORDAN (V.O.)
So here they were, looking for a
smoking gun while I was firing a
bazooka right under their noses.
It was our first IPO, and we were
driving the stock price to the
fucking moon.

BROKER #1
Arncliffe National, it's on fire!

BROKER #2
(voice lowered)
Believe me, your grandkids will
thank you.

BROKER #3
(to Sales Assistant)
Arncliffe National, ten thousand
shares!

Jordan speaks directly to camera as he continues walking
through the bullpen.

JORDAN
See an IPO is an initial public
offering, the first time a stock
is offered for sale to the general
population.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
JORDAN (CONT'D)
As the firm taking the company
public, we set the initial price,

(stops; then)
You know what, you're probably not                  *
following what I'm saying. The                      *
question is, "was it legal?"                        *
Absolutely not. But we were making                  *
more money that we knew what to do                  *

JORDAN (V.O.)
But I figured it out.                               *

Jordan is down on one knee, proposing; Naomi
hyperventilates as he puts the ring on her finger -- a
seven carat, yellow canary diamond in a platinum setting.

JORDAN (V.O.)

A hundred Strattonites flew in

Various images -- Stratton Brokers drink, do coke, a half-

others pour champagne on them.

JORDAN (V.O.)
All told, the weekend cost me
almost two million dollars--

The Tangiers Presidential Suite is a shambles on the           *
level of Hiroshima. A giant crystal chandelier lays
shattered on the floor; Jordan asleep in the massive bed,
a Blue Chip Hooker on either side of him; other passed-
out BODIES lay amid debris and broken, toppled furniture.

JORDAN (V.O.)
But the wedding was like something
out of a fairy tale--


109   EXT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - SUNSET      (DEC `92)              109

Gorgeous; tropical. Hundreds of FAMILY and FRIENDS

look on as Jordan and Naomi walk up the aisle.

JORDAN (V.O.)

safely consummate the marriage.

videographer BARRY KLEINMAN, 40s, approaches Rugrat and
his DATE, ABBY with a video camera:

The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

BARRY KLEINMAN
I'm Barry Kleinman, filming the
wedding -- would you like to say
something to Jordan and Naomi?

RUGRAT / ABBY
Good luck!      We love you!

Across the way, Naomi spots someone through the crowd--

NAOMI
Omigod!   Aunt Emma!

Naomi rushes over, hugs her AUNT EMMA, 50s, demure,
British. Naomi turns, calls out to Jordan, who is now in
a huddle with the guys, his back to her.

NAOMI (CONT'D)
Jordan!   Look!

Jordan turns, then crosses to them, smiling.

AUNT EMMA
Jordan dear, how lovely.

JORDAN
It's so nice to see you again.

As he leans in to hug her, Aunt Emma spots some white
powder on the edge of Jordan's nostril. Deftly, she
wipes it off, smiling.

AUNT EMMA
Into the donuts, I see.

JORDAN
Oh, I'm--- uh...

Aunt Emma leans in to his ear.

AUNT EMMA
I lived through the 60s, my dear.
Enjoy the day.

And with that, she turns back to Naomi.


112   EXT. BAHAMAS - MARINA - DAY       (DEC `92)                      112

With Naomi wearing a blindfold, Jordan leads her to the
end of a long dock, expensive yachts moored everywhere.

JORDAN
Careful now.     You ready?

Jordan removes her blindfold -- there, towering above the
others, is a stunning, 120 foot yacht.

NAOMI
What is this?

JORDAN
Your wedding present.       Check out
the name.

She does; it's called "Naomi".     As she squeals, hugs him-

JORDAN (V.O.)

The camera PUSHES IN past a white-jacketed STEWARD,
who opens the door to the yacht's main salon; next we see
the living room, with its full bar and leather couches;
then the bedroom, with a king bed and monogrammed sheets.

JORDAN (V.O.)
--eventually taking her home to
Long Island, where we'd bought a
house.

Splash!   A glass of water hits him in the face.

NAOMI
Wake up, you bag of shit!

Soaking wet, Jordan sits upright to see Naomi standing
over him in a tiny pink chemise, holding an empty glass.

JORDAN
The fuck are you doing?!

NAOMI
Who's Venice?

JORDAN
What?!

NAOMI
Who is she?! Some little hooker
you fucked last night?

JORDAN

No, really. Donnie and me, we're

NAOMI

JORDAN
California, baby.

NAOMI
Yeah, right.

JORDAN
Duchess, come on.

NAOMI
Don't `Duchess' me, you scumbag.
You think I don't know what you're

you act like an infant!

Splash!   She nails him again, crosses for more water.

JORDAN
Fuck. Naomi!    Why are you so mad?

NAOMI
Where do you want me to start?
How about you flying in here on
your stupid helicopter at three in

You're not the one who researched

JORDAN
You're an aspiring landscape
architect?! But what happened to
wine connoisseur? Oh wait, that
was last month!

NAOMI
Fuck you!

Naomi winds up with the water glass. Jordan stands tall,
puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides.

NAOMI (CONT'D)
Stop flexing your arms, you look
like a fucking imbecile.
(re: his crotch)
And don't think that impresses me
much.

Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.

JORDAN
I wasn't flexing my arms. You're
just lucky to have a husband who's
in such great shape. Now get over
here and kiss me!

NAOMI
Kiss you?!

Splash! She nails him one last time, then storms out.
He stands there dripping wet. To his erection:

JORDAN
Where the fuck were you last
night?

whatever I did the night before.

Next it was a steam so I could

still in my system.


120B   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS              120B


Jordan looks at a Visine bottle - "Recommended Dosage -
Two Drops". He squirts six drops in each eye.
What kind of maniac abuses eye
drops?
Fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits, Jordan
pops two white pills, swigs some juice.
Then I'd get dressed, take my
"back pills" to get me started,
then attempt to make up with her.
Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. On the fluffy
pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her
hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes. Between
her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter.
Hey, Skylar.
Good morning Daddy. Where's my
kiss?
Does Daddy get to kiss both his
girls?
Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get
to touch Mommy for a very, very
long time.
Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she's
wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan.
C'mon, Nay, please. You know how
sorry I am. I swear I
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.
And from now on it's going to be
nothing but short, short skirts
around the house! And Mommy's
so sick and tired of wearing
panties, uhhh. In fact she's
decided to throw them all away.
(parting her thighs)
So take a good look. You'll be
seeing an awful lot of it around
the house, but no touching.
What's wrong, Daddy?
Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking

C'mon, why are you doing this?
I said I'm sorry.
Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to
say how wrong he is when he's
ready to come in his own pants.
Isn't that right Dada? Mommy loves
Daddy so, so much and there's
nothing she wants to do more right
now than to make love to Daddy all
day long. Well, I guess it's time
for Daddy to be taught his first
lesson.
I wouldn't do that if I were you
Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a
story before she decides to please
herself like that.
Can Daddy tell Mommy a story?
And does mommy promise to keep her
legs spread wide, wide open the
whole time
Good. Once upon a time there was
a great big mansion in Long Island
and the people who lived there had
lots and lots of money. But of
all the possessions they had,
there was one thing that was much
more valuable than all the rest
combined, and that was their
little baby daughter.
Now because he was very security-
conscious, the Daddy hired two
full-time guards, big hairy men
both named Rocco, and they
installed security cameras all
around the house. And one of
those cameras is right over
Daddy's shoulder.
So smile, Mommy! You're on Candid
Camera!
You asshole!
The good thing about living with
a world-class ballbreaker is they
make all the other ballbreakers in
your life a little easier to take.
Steve here yet?
On his way. Very excited
Good.   Cuz we have a problem.
He indicates out to the Bullpen. Donnie and Janet look.
Is he wearing a bow tie?
In the Bullpen WE SEE a young Stratton Broker in a bowtie
cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk.
He's got nothing better to do on
the day of the biggest IPO in this
firm's history?!
The fuck you doing?
Cleaning my fishbowl.
Oh.
On new issue day?! On
cocksucking, motherfucking
new issue day?
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!
Now take your bowtie, get your
shit and get the fuck out!
The Cobbler.    Ready to get rich?
Hey buddy.
Steve Madden, the shoe designer,
was a childhood friend of
Donnie's, but I didn't hold that
against him. Remember those ads,
those giant-headed girls with bug
eyes wearing those big clunky
shoes?
He came to me a few years earlier
when he was just starting out, so
I became a silent partner in his
company, buying an 85% stake for
only a million bucks.
The company blew up and we were
now taking it public. It was the
biggest deal we'd ever done and
the hottest IPO on Wall Street.
--which is why they need to meet
you.
You gotta get `em fired up so
they'll push the shit out of this
stock.
Let them feel your passion.
Uhhh... excuse me...
For those of you who don't know
me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm --
We know who you are!
I uh, I'd like to start by telling
you about my background in the
shoe industry.
Nice fucking hat!
I uh... first started working in
the shoe industry, in a shoe
store. When I was sixteen, my
friends were out chasing girls,
but I was learning about women's
shoes.
Move the mike closer.We can't fucking hear you!
Sorry... Anyway, my first job
was at a shoe store like I said
where I worked in the stockroom.
You know, I can honestly say I've
been a lover of women's shoes
since I was twelve--
No. Heh-heh. Not like that.
I mean somehow I became fascinated
with the endless design
possibilities for women's shoes--
Queer! Get a fucking life!
This shoe the Mary Lou
the one that really put me on the
map. It's a black patent leather
variation of the Mary Jane, but
All right, let's hear it for Steve
Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!
Okay, now that you got that out
of your system, I want you to know
why Steve is so completely off the
fucking wall... It's because this
man is a creative genius. Steve's
power, his gift -- is that he
creates trends. Artists like
Steve come along once a century!
Elvis! Andy Warhol!    Giorgio
Armani! Who knows how high this
stock could go? The 20s? The
50s? The 80s?
I want everybody to look down.
See that little black box in front
of you? It's called a telephone.
Now I'm gonna let you in on a
little secret about this
telephone -- it won't dial itself!
That's right -- until you take
some action, it's nothing more
than a worthless hunk of plastic,
like a loaded M16 without a
trained Marine to pull the
trigger. And in the case of the
telephone, it's the action of you,
a highly trained Strattonite, a
killer who will not take no for an
answer!   A person who will not
hang up the phone until his client
either buys or fucking dies!
I don't care if you graduated from
Harvard or Bumfuck University or
never got past fourth fucking
grade! That phone is the great
equalizer!
There is no nobility in poverty.
I've been rich, and I've been poor
and I choose rich every time.
At least as a rich man, when I
have to face my problems, I show
up in the back of a limo wearing a
$2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch!
And if anyone here thinks I'm
crazy, get the fuck out and get a
job at McDonald's, because that's
where you fucking belong! But
before you depart this room full
of winners, I want you to take a
good look at the person next to
you, because one day in the not-so-
distant future, you'll be sitting
at a red light in your beat-up old
Pinto, and that person's gonna
pull up in a brand new Porsche,
with their gorgeous young wife at
their side. And who will you be
next to? Some ugly beast with
three days of razor-stubble in a
sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in
next to you with a carload of
groceries from the fucking Price
Club!
So you listen to me and listen
carefully. Are you behind on your
credit card bills? Good. Pick up
the phone and start dialing. Is
your landlord threatening to evict
you? Good. Pick up the phone and
start dialing. Does your
girlfriend think you're a fucking
loser? Pick up the phone and
start fucking dialing! I want
you to deal with your problems by
becoming rich! I want you to go
out and spend money! Leverage
yourself, back yourself into a
corner, let the consequences of
failure become so fucking
unthinkable that you'll have no
choice but to do whatever it takes
to win!
You have an obligation here,
people! To your clients! To this
firm! An obligation to yourself,
godammit! You ram Steve Madden
stock down your clients' throats
and make them choke on it till
they buy 20,000 shares! Be
aggressive! Be ferocious! Be
At 1 p.m. we opened the stock for
sale at $4.50 a share. By 1:03
it was over eighteen dollars.
--the hottest new issue on up two dollars while I'm
Wall Street talking to you!
Of course I couldn't have done
this without help. I'd leaked the
word on Wall Street that Stratton
was a buyer up until twenty. So
not only were we pushing Madden,
all the big firms were too.
As long as they knew I'd buy the
shares back at the top of the
market, they'd drive the price
up as high as I fucking wanted.
Of the two million shares being
offered for sale, a million
belonged to me, held in phony
accounts by my ratholes. Once the
price hit the high teens, I--
Like I said before, who gives a
shit? As always, the point is
this
22 million in three fucking hours!
They toast, then each pop ludes, which they wash down
with champagne. A quick knock; Janet pops her head in.
Janet, baby.    Drink.
Call for you.    Barry Kleinman from
Future Video?
Who?
He filmed your wedding.     He says
it's urgent.

Barry?
Jordan, hey. Listen, I got a
subpoena. The FBI wants a copy
of your wedding video.
On Jordan.    Uh-oh
The F-B-fucking-I?
Name's Denham, he's an agent in
the New York office.
He's a boy scout, thinks you're
Gordon Gekko.
But my goddamn wedding video?
Got your whole inner circle in one
place, faces and names. He's
hoping it rattles you, or maybe
your wife, so that she starts
nagging you to turn witness.
What? He wants me to rat on
myself?
Good news is I made some calls,
DEA, Justice? No one but him even
knows who you are.
Can you bug him or something, tap
his phone?
Jordan, relax. First off, you
don't fuck with these guys, not
that way. Secondly, I got a P.I.
license, you know?
Maybe I should call him, see what
he wants.
No! Anybody does that should be
your lawyer. What you do is eat
your dinner, drink your drink, and
forget about it. Cuz as far as I
hear he doesn't have shit.
Patrick? Hey! C'mon aboard!
Plank's right down there.
Mr. Belfort, I'm Agent Denham.
This is Agent Hughes.
Heya! This is Nicole and,
um...Heidi. Girls, Patrick and...?
Agents Denham and Hughes. Your
message said you wanted to speak
privately.
It did. I do.
Oh, they're just friends.
Give us a minute, okay?
The Hookers head below deck. Jordan shoots Denham a wink--
check out that ass!
Can I get a glass? Got wine open
or any kinda booze. Shrimp and
lobster're over there if you're
hungry.
Bureau forbids us from drinking at
sea.
the guy has a sense of humor.
I have something for you, I just
gotta find it. Have a seat, will
ya? Ever been on one of these
before?
A boat? Learned to sail when I was
six.
I mean, one like this. Just had
her extended to put a chopper on
the back.
Never been on a boat with a second
mode of transportation on top of
it.
What is this?
Names and addresses of every guest
at my wedding. Friends, clients. I
even threw in the seating chart.
Heard that's why you wanted the
video, figured this'd expedite
whatever it is you're doing.
I wanted to show you I've got
nothing to hide. I know you're
investigating Stratton but for the
life of me I can't figure out why.
Sure, my company is unorthodox;
what brokerage isn't? Maybe we're
a little louder than most but we
don't do anything illegal. Talk to
the SEC, they'll tell you, they
checked us out up and down.
The SEC's actually a civil
regulatory agency. We pursue
criminal activity.
That's what I'm saying. You guys
take on real crime. Which is why
I'm so curious: what do you think
we did?
I can't discuss ongoing
investigations.
I understand.
Though, to be frank, this case
kinda got dumped on my desk. Some
higher-up felt your shop needed
looking into after all that press,

You know who you should be looking
at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers,
Merrill.
What those guys're up to with
collateralized debt obligations?
This internet stock bullshit?
C'mon. If you want, I'll walk you
through exactly
-- that'd be great. And if there's
anything you can give me just to
close out your file, get it off my
desk sure, get you back to the real
criminals
-- then we could both profit from
this little sit-down.
You sure you don't want anything
to drink? Water for your pal?
(Denham demurs)
Rumor is your started out in
finance. Even got your broker's
license before you joined the
bureau.
Who told you that?
Ever regret it? Giving up the
money-crazed, pin-striped life?
Ever think where you'd be if you'd
stuck with it?
When I'm riding the subway home,
sweating my balls off, in a suit
I've worn three days, sure.
Whattaya pull in working at the
bureau, if you don't mind me
asking. 50-60K a year?
Just about. We get a free handgun
out of it, though, that doesn't
S'crazy, the world we live in, the
jobs with real value, the ones we
should appreciate -- firefighters,
teachers, FBI agents -- those are
the ones we pay the least.
Way of the world.
That's one thing I like about what
I do, the opportunity to make that
right. Take this kid we had
interning last year. Didn't want
to be a broker, wanted to be an
environmental scientist or
something, he had a student loan
debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway,
his mom gets sick, all they can
afford is third-rate care. Some of
us got together, made an
investment on his behalf and --
boom -- overnight everything
changes, she's seeing the best
doctors in the country. Sadly,
didn't work out, she passed but
still: having the power to do that
makes all the other bullshit worth
while.
See, it's all about proper
guidance, Pat. Knowing someone
with the right relationships,
who's discreet. I can change a
life almost every day.
They measure each other.
How much that intern make off your
deal?
North of half a million.
I believe Mr. Belfort just tried
to bribe a federal officer.
What? I was making conversation.
Sounds like that to me, Jordan.
...no, no, no...
...sounded like that...
...no, to constitute a bribe,
don't I have to make an explicit
offer of money for services? With
an exact dollar figure attached?
All I said was "north" of half a
million. According to the U.S.
Criminal Code, that dog won't
hunt, Pat.
(then)
Heard you were a straight arrow.
That you wouldn't bend the rules
other agents might. He was right.
You did a background check on me?
Figured you were looking into me,
was only fair. Plus you sail on a
yacht fit for a Bond villain,
This is why you invited me down to
your yacht? With a couple hookers
on it
-- to get a sense of the guy who
was coming after you?
"you got me."
Thanks for coming down. Now get
off my boat.
You know, most of the Wall Street
jackasses I bust, they were born
to the life.
Their father was a douchebag
before them, and his father before
that. But you, you got this way
all on your own. Good for you,
You know, this is about the nicest
boat I've ever been on. Just think
what a hero I'll be in the office
when the bureau seizes it.
Hey, Denham! I'm gonna eat a claw
of lobster now as I get my cock
sucked by Heidi down below. You
have a super ride home on the
subway thinking about that!
He was a numbers guy, a follow-the-
fucking-money'er. He wasn't gonna
come at me through my guys,
looking for a weak link and a
quick kill. He was gonna come at
me like an accountant would, the
way Ness got Capone, through my
books. Which meant? It was ass-
covering time.
Switzerland? What the fuck is in
Switzerland?
Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you
fucking think?
Rugrat set up a meeting with a
Swiss Banker he knew from law
school who could launder our
money, but it wasn't till noon
the next day.
I knew if I timed my lude intake
right, I'd sleep through the
entire overnight flight.
At four p.m. I popped a few ludes,
which started kicking in by the
time I finished our sales meeting.
This was the tingle phase.
Over dinner, a visibly high Jordan ravenously digs into
his food as Donnie and four Blue Chip Hookers look on.
By dinner I popped a few more on
top of some cocktails and an
valium or two. The slur phase.
On the crowded dance floor, Jordan gets knocked around
like a marionette, saliva strung from his mouth.
By eight thirty I'd done a few
more and pretty much lost my motor
skills. This was the drool phase.
And by ten I didn't know who or
what I was doing -- the amnesia
phase. We boarded the plane just
before midnight.
Sweetheart! Look at you!
Donnie. Donnie, wake up.
Nuuhh?
Untie me, shitbag. You think this
I didn't tie you, the captain did.
He almost tasered you.
Why?
This was fucking great. I hadn't
laundered a dime yet and already
I was under arrest.
Worse yet was the plastic baggie
of ludes that Donnie'd stuffed up
his ass.
But before he could even get a
hemorrhoid--
Jordan Belfort! At last!
Nicholas has told me so much.
Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.
Nice to make your acquaintance.
This is some lobby you got.
Ah, yes. We gave our designer an
unlimited budget and he exceeded
it. Come! You must tell me all
about your adventure with the
stewardess over coffee!
Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and
one other SWISS BANKER. It's an impressive office, with
an enormous fish tank.
We have a joke in America.
"Heaven is a place where the
police are Brits, the chefs are
Italian, the car mechanics are
German, the prostitutes are French
and the bankers are Swiss." I
never got it `til now -- look at
those fucking fish! Come here,
little guy...
Yes, we have the same joke here.
Only sometimes the English are
chauffeurs and the chefs are
French. The Germans, alas, are
always mechanics; no one wants to
grant them more authority than
that.
Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish,
cuts straight to the point:
I'm curious about your bank
secrecy laws.
Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom
requires ten minutes of idle chit-
chat before business can be
discussed.
Of course, let's get "down to it."
What would you like to know?
Under what circumstances would you
be obligated to cooperate with an
FBI or U.S. Justice Department
investigation?
Ca depend.
Ca depend?      Ca depend on what?
Whether America plans to invade
Switzerland in the coming months.
Want me to see if tanks are
rolling down the Rue de la Croix?
What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over.
I understand perfectly, you
American shitheel.
The only way the Banque Real de
Geneve would cooperate with a
foreign legal body is if the crime
being pursued also happened to be
a crime in Switzerland. But there
are very few Swiss laws pertaining
to your "rumored" improprieties.
Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is
most appropriate: from a financial
standpoint you are now in heaven,
and we welcome you. If the U.S.
Justice Department or FBI or SEC
or IRS sent us a subpoena, it
would become papier-toillette. We
would wipe our ass with it.
Unless it was an investigation
into stock fraud -- which is a
crime in Switzerland. Then you'd
have to cooperate.
Yes, we would. Assuming the
account is under your name.
However, if it were in the name of
a nominee of yours...
Was that yodeling I just heard or
did you just say what I thought
you said?
He was telling me to use a
rathole. Problem was: sneaking a
U.S. rathole into Switzerland was
a chance I couldn't take. What I
needed was somebody with a
European passport.
So tell me about this plan of
yours.
I'd like us to go to Switzerland
tomorrow so you can open an
account. I'll fund it, and I'll
pay you really well for your
trouble.
Oh my.
Next month maybe you can fly to
New York and we can start moving
the cash.
Moving the ca
I feel like a character in an
Ian Fleming novel. It's all quite
racy, isn't it?
It is, and it's illegal too. Of
course if you ever got in trouble,
I'd come forward in two seconds,
say I duped you, but even still.
Risk is what keeps us young, isn't
it darling?
I like that attitude. Promise me
you'll spend at least ten thousand
pounds per month out of the
account, okay?
I wouldn't even know how. I
really do have everything I need.
But I bet you don't have
everything you want. How about a
bigger apartment so your grandkids
can sleep over?
Aunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety. He's
jonesing.
Shall we sit?
Sure, that'd be great.
They sit on a nearby bench. After a while:
Sometimes I wonder if you let
money get the best of you, dear.
Among other substances.
It's that obvious, huh?
It's the height of summer and
you've got the chills.
I'm a drug addict, Emma. Coke,
pills, you name it, whatever you
got. Sex addict too.
Well there are worse things to be
addicted to than sex.
Why did I just tell you that?
Because I'm very easy to talk to.
A few beats, then:
As a matter of fact you are. My
job, you know, it's tough. I mean
I'm not complaining, it's just the
stress. All these people depending
on me. Millions of dollars at
stake every day. I sometimes feel
I've bitten off more than I can
chew.
You're a man with large appetites.
Is she fucking hitting on me?
I agree. I put it on myself. It's
hard to control the anxiety, you
know? It's hard to learn to relax.
To release the tension.
She is hitting on me! Holy shit!
Exactly, to release the tension.
Sometimes you gotta learn to do
what comes natural in life, huh?
Is he fucking hitting on me?
You take care of my niece, my
love. And I'll take care of
everything over here.
Ah, once upon a time.
When I got home, I realized there
was no way Aunt Emma could smuggle
that much cash by herself. I
racked my brain for another person
with a foreign passport.
Bra-had, theese tape eez focking
steeky!
As a successful drug dealer, Brad
spent his winters in the South of
France, which is where he met his
wife Chantalle, a stripper of
Slovenian origin but born in, of
all places, Switzerland.
Shut up, bitch.
You beetch, you focking douche-a-
Donnie can't help but start laughing at this.
Take eet off!    Take eet off!
Well, this is fucked.
It's gonna take her like fifty
trips.
We'll get her parents to tape up
too. They got Swiss passports.
Plus her brother and his wife.
Five people, six-seven trips?
How much'll they want for it?
I dunno, not much. Fuck, they'd
probably do it just for the miles.
What about my money?
What?
My money. I got a few mil of my
own I wanna move. I'll call you,
And you can come "pick it up."
Don't make me deal with this
fucknut, okay?
Donnie?   He's just high is all.
I dunno if he's stupid or a junkie
but he's a loose fuckin' cannon.
I don't trust him and I don't want
Jesus. I thought he was your best
customer.
I only sell to him cuz he's your
friend.
Can you just do one trip for him?
Brad stews.   It's asking a lot.
I'll meet him but I won't pick up.
I have a limit of how much of that
douchebag I can take.
I can hear you, motherfucker!
I'm a douchebag?!! Well, whose
fucking idea was it made us all
this money?!! Who fucking knew
Steve Madden?!! This douchebag!!
So go fuck yourself a little!
The next day, Aunt Emma flew to
Geneva, two million in cash in her
carry-on.
Which in the big picture was a
drop in the Swiss bucket --
-- because the following month,
over the course of six round-
trips, Chantalle and her family
smuggled in over twenty million
without even a hiccup.
Fu Manchu!      Kung fu!
I'm just fucking with you, man.
Jesus, the look on your face.
Hey, sorry if I got outta line the
other day, I was just, that was
the drugs talking...
S'cool, just... gimme the case.
You know, I always kinda regretted
you didn't come to work with us at
Stratton. It'd be so cool having
you around, man.
Yeah, well...
You'd be one of us, we'd go out-
partying together, you wouldn't
have to dress like a mall rat
guinea prison bitch all the time.
Give me the money.
Can I come over and help tape this
to your wife? "Eez so focking
steeky! Take eet off, Bra-hod!"
I'm gonna give you a pass.
You're what?
I'm gonna give you a pass.
You're gonna give me a pass?
Yes.    Just gimme the money.
You're gonna give me a pass?
Why don't you stick your pass up
your Slavic cunt's pussy.
That does it. Brad attacks. Donnie throws the case at
him, which opens on impact, money spilling out. Brad
instinctively tries to contain it... and that's when the
POLICE SIRENS start. Here comes the patrol car.
Donnie bolts. With no time to get to his car, Brad takes
off on foot, bleeding briefcase in hand, toward a video
store where he stashes his .38 in the return box.
Brd drops to his knees, briefcase at his feet. From a
distance, Donnie peers around a corner to watch him get
arrested, knowing he fucked this up.
Jord, do I have a surprise for
you. Twenty real lemons! A retired
pharmacist friend of mine's been
sitting on these the last 15
years.
You fucking serious?!
The Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail
of Quaaludes, outlawed since the
`80s and three times as powerful
as anything available today. For
a Quaalude addict, it was like
finding a 1952 Chateau Margaux.
CLOSE ON -- Donnie gauging Jordan's excitement, waiting
for the right moment to admit his fuck-up.
I'd been saving these for a
special occasion, like a birthday
or celebrating our money being out
of the country. Instead I thought
I'd better use `em to help break
That night I cleared my schedule
and rid my body of anything that
could fuck with my high. It was
celebration time.
Start with one, see how it goes?
My guy says one's all we'll need.
You feeling anything?
Nope.
Thirty five minutes.
Maybe we've built up a tolerance
all these years?
they pop another, wash it down with sake
This is bullshit, man. My fucking
metabolism's pumping and I don't
feel shit.
They're old, maybe they lost their
potency.
Donnie leans over, picks up the bottle. Reads the label.
January `81. They're fucking
duds.
Nothing.   Working out.
Bo Dietl's on the phone.
Bo, hey, what's up?
I need to talk to you, but not on
this phone.
Why, what's
Leave the house, call me back
from a pay phone, you hear me?
The Brookville Country Club was a
WASP stronghold, a straight shot
down the road from my house.
Jordan pulls up, exits the car in sweats, flip-flops and
a T-shirt. He hustles up a staircase into...
Jordan?
Yeah, I'm at a pay phone.       What's
going on?
Your buddy Brad's in jail.
Oh, Jesus Christ! What did he do?
I dunno yet, they arrested him in
a shopping mall in Long Island
this morning, I'm finding out.
But listen to me. More important
than that. The guy Denham I told
you about, the Fed? He's got your
phones tapped, I'm pretty sure.
Home and office.
Donnie, that piece of shit. I'm
gonna kill him! That fat prick
mother fucker!
But, listen to me. Do me a favor,
please do not talk on the phone.
Fuck!
Did you try to bribe this fuckin'
guy?
What? No! I didn't try to bribe
anybody!
Jordan? I couldn't understand
you. Say that again?
I zay I zint ty zoo bibe azybuzzy!
Are you fucking high?
After fifteen years in storage,
the Lemmons had developed a
delayed fuse.
It took 90 minutes for the little
fuckers to kick in, but once they
did -- pow! I had skipped the
tingle phase and went straight to
the drool phase.
Actually I'd discovered a new
phase: the cerebral palsy phase.
Jordan! Jordan! Do not get behind
the wheel! Just tell me where
you're at, I'll send Rocco!
C'mon, stand up!
Okay, walking is off the list of
options. All right, what else is
there?
(a brainstorm)
I can crawl, like Skylar!
Fuck!   The kid makes it look so
easy!
Think, you motherfucker, think!
Wait, I've got it!
I can roll!
...ello?
Omigod!    Jordan, where are you?!
Whazz a marra?
It's Donnie, he's totally out of
control! He's on the other line
with some Swiss guy!
Whaa?!!    No!!
I can't understand you! Just get
home, hurry!
They say God protects drunks and
babies. I was praying the same
held true for drug addicts.
I was less than a mile from home
Somehow I made it alive, not a
scratch on me or the car.
Where Zonnie?!
In the kitchen.
--zee money, I wazza move izz to
Zwizzyland...
What language are you speaking,
Mr. Azoff?
Ge ozza zone!     Ge ozza iz!!

WUZZ?!
Omigod, he's choking!     Jordan, do
something!!
He's not breathing!
Save him!
This stupid sonovabitch! All
Donnie ever did was fuck me up and
now I had to save his life `cause
I took a CPR class when the baby
was learning to swim. Just for
the record, I want it noted: not
for a second did I even think
about letting him choke to death,
even though it would've saved me
an awful lot of headaches.
He won't come back!
Don't let him die! He has
children!
Yes?
Sir, we need to ask you some
questions.
Wow. Maybe I hadn't made it home
okay.
It was an absolute miracle I
wasn't killed, and an even bigger
miracle I hadn't killed anyone.
But they couldn't arrest me, the
cops had no proof I'd been behind
the wheel. Meanwhile, Brad did a
few months in jail for contempt
because he wouldn't rat Donnie
out. They never found his gun,
though, so they finally had to let
him go.
You're a lucky guy, Jordan.
Legally I've never seen anyone
slip a noose the way you do.
Christ, you're lucky to be alive
much less not in jail.

JORDAN
I don't believe in luck.

MANNY RISKIN
That's what all lucky people say.
It's time, Jordan. Let me make a
deal with SEC. Before your luck
runs out.

Skylar waves from the pony and Jordan waves back.

JORDAN
What kind of terms?

MANNY RISKIN
You plead guilty to a handful of
securities violations -- stock
manipulation, high pressure sales
tactics, ticky-tack shit like
that. You pay a few million
dollars in fines and in exchange
the SEC fucks off for all time.

JORDAN
And Stratton?    What happens there?
105.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

MANNY RISKIN
You'd have to walk away. Let
Donnie take over.
(that one hurts)
Now the FBI's a different animal.
They can still pursue you for
criminal wrongdoing. But with you
on the sidelines, my guess is your
best friend Agent Denham'll be
left standing around with his dick
in his hand.

Jordan digests that.

MAX
You beat them, Jordan. You won.
Sail into the sunset with your
wife and kids while you can.

MANNY RISKIN
God knows you'll never have to
work again.

As Jordan looks at his picture-perfect family, WE HEAR
THE ROAR OF A CROWD...

202E   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY                      202E
(SPRING `96)

The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage.

JORDAN
I'm sure many of you have been
hearing rumors lately, about me,
about the future of this firm, and
that's what I'd like to talk to
you about today.
(a few beats, then)
Five years ago when I started
Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew
the day would eventually come when
I'd be moving on. It's truly with
a heavy heart that I tell you that
day is here.

The place erupts in a chorus of "No!", "Don't go!", etc.
Jordan raises his hand for quiet.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
Thank you for that and for your
years of incredible loyalty and
admiration.
106.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
JORDAN (CONT'D)
The point is though, that under
Donnie's leadership, along with
Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff
moving into key management
positions, this place is gonna be
better than ever!

A smattering of applause. Jordan notices a few Brokers
gravely shaking their heads.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
And the fact that I'm gone won't
stop me from giving Donnie advice,
not that he needs any--

DONNIE
(jumping in)
Why would anyone in their right
mind not follow JB's advice?

Donnie looks petrified; he's used to being an offensive
tackle, not the quarterback.

JORDAN
Before I go, there's something I
want to remind you all, and that's
this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger
than any one person, even me.
Especially me. You guys are
Stratton, each and every one of
you, and that is why it's sure to
remain the best brokerage firm in
the fucking world!

Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all
300 Brokers on their feet. WE PUSH IN on Jordan.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
See, the very idea of Stratton is
that when you come here and step
into this bullpen for the first
time, you start your life anew.
You have a place here and no one
can take that away from you!
Stratton Oakmont is America! Give
me your tired and poor! The very
moment you walk through that door
and pledge your loyalty to this
firm, you become part of a family,
you become a Strattonite! It
doesn't matter who you are, it
doesn't matter where you're from!
Whether your family came over on
the Mayflower or on a fucking
inner tube from Haiti!
107.
The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

More applause. Jordan scans the young faces -- they
worship him. In the crowd he finds KIMMIE BELZER, 30s.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
Everybody here knows Kimmie
Belzer, right?

Hoots and hollers...      He raises his hand for quiet.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
In case any of you weren't aware
of it, Kimmie was one of
Stratton's first brokers, one of
the original twenty. Now when
most of you met Kimmie, you met
her the way she is today -- a
beautiful woman who drives a brand
new Mercedes, a woman who lives in
the finest condo complex on Long
Island. A woman who wears $3000
Armani suits, who spends her
winters in the Bahamas and her
summers in the Hamptons!

Wild applause.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
But that's not the Kimmie I met.
The Kimmie I met was broke, a
single mom on the balls of her
ass. Three months behind on her
rent with an eight year old son!
She came to me for a job and when
I hired her she asked for a $5000
dollar advance so she could pay
his tuition. And what did I do,
Kimmie?

KIMMIE
You wrote me a check for $25,000!

JORDAN
Because I believed in you, like
I believe in each and every one
of you!

KIMMIE
I love you, Jordan!

As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the
adoration. He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd,
looks out at the faces. A change has come over him.
He stands there, thinking. An eternity, then:

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

JORDAN
You know for years I've been
telling you guys not to take no
for an answer, to keep pushing,
to not hang up the phone till you
get what you want. This deal I'm
about to sign, barring me from the
securities industry, barring me
from Stratton, my home... What the
fuck is that? I'll tell you what
it is, it's me being a hypocrite.
It's me taking no for an answer,
it's them selling me, not the
other way around! Fuck it, I'm
not leaving!

Jordan smiles, thrusts his hands in the air --

JORDAN (CONT'D)
THE SHOW GOES ON!!

The place goes absolutely INSANE. And as Donnie and Max
trade looks, TECHNO MUSIC BLASTS taking us to...

JORDAN (V.O.)

ON ANOTHER BAG, this one brimming with bottles of pills,
bags of pot, vials of coke. Jordan and Donnie cut up
lines as a HOSTESS serves Bloody Marys.

HOSTESS
Can I get you anything else,
gentlemen?

I have a rare condition that
requires me to drink one of these

Thanks but where does this leave

goes into probate or what?

SAUREL
Not to worry, Jordan. Your aunt,
before she died, signed a document
naming you as her successor.

JORDAN
She did?!

SAUREL

Well. Not as of yet.

And as they continue talking, Jordan pulls out a nautical

says it's safe.
Chop is fine.
Is it safe?
If we take it slow...
We can do it?
Chop is chop. Some chop - it can
be uncomfortable.
Well, that's fine.
Anything is possible. I mean we'll
have to batten down the hatches
just to be safe. Could be a few
broken dishes.
A few broken dishes. Isn't that
great? Let's go to Monaco
The perfect storm. As the Naomi tips at a 45-degree
angle, a thick wall of gray water comes rising over her
side, slamming onto the bridge with a thunderous CRASH.
Well talk about your shitty
vacations...
Donnie and Naomi stand on the bridge where Captain Ted
Beecham holds the ship's wheel with both hands, the radio
blaring in the background. Jordan enters.
Jet skis just went overboard.
Gale warning! Gale warning!
The waves are twenty feet and
building!
Can't you turn us around?!
We'll get broad-sided and tip
over!
Gale warning! Gale warning!
You happy now, you piece of shit?
We're gonna drown.
I'm a master diver. We will not
drown, I promise you. I got you,

Mayday! This is Captain Ted
Beecham aboard the Yacht Naomi!
This is a Mayday!
We are going down at the head
fifty miles off the coast of Rome
and we require immediate
assistance!
Off to the side, Jordan watches as Naomi, their Friends,
and the yacht's Crew Members dance to blaring techno
music. A small group of Italian SAILORS cheer them on.
The nice thing about getting
rescued by Italians is that the
first thing they do is feed you
and make you drink red wine.
Then they make you dance.
Jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually
glances out a porthole, where WE SEE the distant lights
of a PLANE making its way across the night sky. After a
few beats, the plane EXPLODES, a tiny flash of light.
Did you see that? That was the
plane I sent for to come get us.
I shit you not, it exploded when
a seagull flew into the engine,
three people killed. You want a
sign from God, well after all this
I finally got the message. I had

My name is Jordan Belfort and
there's no secret to wealth

SYSTEM OF SELLING that within a

beginnings, I now live here...with
my beautiful wife and
kids...living the lifestyle of our
dreams...
Now I'm passing along the secrets
to my success in my 90-minute free
seminar, "Jordan Belfort's
Straight Line Persuasion."
I have here in my hand, framed, is
a check for twenty-seven thousand
four hundred and thirty-seven
dollars and sixty-three cents that
I netted from one deal after
attending Jordan Belfort's, um,
Straight Line Persuasion seminar.
There's nobody stopping you from
making millions. There is nobody
holding you back from financial
freedom.
Thank You Sweet Heart.
Don't just sit at home or the life
of your dreams will sail right
past you.
Thanks to the Straight Line
System, we could afford this home
and now we're living the lives of
our dreams.
I've changed all these people's
lives and I can change yours, too!

Rugrat, he'd been busted down in
Miami, and guess who the fuck
with?
What were the odds? There had to
be ten thousand Swiss bankers in
Geneva and I choose the one dumb
enough to get himself arrested on
U.S. soil.
Even more ironic was he'd gotten
himself indicted on charges that
had nothing to fucking do with me.
Something about laundering drug
money through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki, the
founder of Benihana.
A smiling Rocky Aoki looks on as a HIBACHI CHEF expertly

Beni-fucking-hana! Why would God
be so cruel as to choose a chain

Saurel lays on the bed, smoking.
Long story short was Saurel ratted
me out, but not before he ratted
out Chantalle, who it turns out
he'd been fucking every time she
went to Switzerland!

subpoena.
This is...well, it's not good.
It's pretty bad actually. How
much money do you have, Jordan?
I can make bail.
I don't mean the ten million, I
mean for legal fees. Cuz if you
want to fight this thing, it's
gonna be expensive. Like, sell
everything-you-own-expensive.
Jordan exits the building. He's fucked and he knows it.
He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a
limosine; life isn't totally hopeless. He approaches.
Nay, thank God. I'm so glad
you're here.
They embrace. He can't see her expression: she'd rather
be anywhere else.
Hey, everybody! How're the
happiest people in Long Island?
Hi, Rocky!!
Hate that fucking dog.
Tell me about it. It's getting
old, starting to shit inside the
house again.
How you doing, brother? How was
the food in jail?
Lobster Newburg sucked. They gave
me some jewelry though.
He shows off the electronic bracelet around his ankle.
Wonder if they got one in my size.
Fuckin' Rugrat, that wig-wearin'
hump. Tell you one thing: I'm
never eating at Benihana's again.
Where's Naomi?
Inside. Pissed.
What's up her ass?
Had to mortgage the home to make
bail. Probably gonna hafta sell
it to pay my lawyers. If we fight
this thing.
Donnie weighs that.
The Feds say anything about coming
after the rest of us?
Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.
You know, we're all behind you.
Everyone at the office.
We bought back your mortgage. All
the founding partners threw in a
million apiece. Figured none of
us would have it if it weren't for
you.
Jordan's profoundly touched. Donnie squeezes his
shoulder. A real moment of friendship.
You gotta fight this thing, baby.
Like I said, loyalty meant a lot
to me. Without your friends and
family standing behind you, you're
fucked.
There's a term we have around
here, we don't like to use it
often, only when circumstances
dictate. It's called a "Grenada."
Inspired by our government's
invasion in 1983 of the island
nation of only 90,000 people,
basically it stands for any case
we get which is pretty much unlose-
able. We could show up late and
drunk to court, fuck up left-right-
and-center and still we'd win.
Mr. Belfort, you, sir, are a
"Grenada."
You're looking at real prison
time. Money laundering gets you
as much as 20 years. Case
couldn't be stronger if we'd have
caught you with your cash in your
mattress.
Solomon pushes a box full of evidence across the table.
Jordan eyeballs Denham.
Read the discovery.
That your life's work in the box?
Jordan, you rotting in jail til
your kids're outta college isn't
our ambition here. You weren't
the only one involved in all this.
We think those folks deserve their
day in court too.
Why do I get the sense there's an
offer in the air? If so, let's
put it on the table.
You want me to rat?
We want your cooperation in
Yes.   We want you to rat.
How was Christy's party?
It was fine.
Baby, I talked to the lawyers
again today. I have some really
great news. As it turns out you're
totally off the hook.
I know that already.
You never did anything wrong
anyway, right? At the end of the
day all they really want is for me
to cooperate - that's it.
See, apparently, I know so much
about what's going on in the stock
market that I could save the
government years of heartache. But
it get's even better... You see,
if I cooperate I'll only have to
serve four short years and any
fine I'd have to pay wouldn't be
due til after I serve my sentence.
We'll still have plenty of money
left over. The only thing that I
was kind of upset about was the
fact that I might have to give
them information about my friends.
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street".
But there's a silver lining to
that too... It turns out that all
of `em are probably gonna
cooperate too. So in the end, that
won't really be a factor.
Well, that's really good news,
honey. I'm really happy for you.
No, it's good for both of us, Nay.
Yeah, yeah.
Make love to me baby. Make love to
me nice and slow
No Jordan. Stop!
Jordan is fucking Naomi. It's the best he's
felt in days. While he's lost in it, she's lost interest,
going through the motions perfunctorily.
I love you, Nay. I love you so
much. I've loved you from the
first time I saw you.
Fuck you.
That stops him.
What?
I fucking hate you.
What are you talking about?
You don't give a shit about how I
feel. All you care about is
yourself
That's not true. What do you mean?
You wanna fuck me? Fine. Fuck me
hard like it's the last time.
Hold still. Why are you moving
like that?
Go ahead, fuck me!
What are you doing baby?
Cum for me. Cum for me, baby. Like
it's the last time.
You want me to cum, baby?
Yeah, cum for me baby, cum!
After a beat... He cums. Jordan rolls off Naomi. They lie
in uncomfortable silence.
Jordan, that was the last time. I
want a divorce.
What are you talking about?
I want a divorce.
What? What are you talking about?
Now? After we just made love?
And I wanted to puke.
I don't love you anymore Jordan. I
haven't for a long time.
You don't love me? Isn't that
convenient. Now, you don't love
me? Now while I'm under federal
indictment with a fucking bracelet
around my ankle? Now, all of a
sudden, you decide you don't love
me?
Yes, that's right.
What kind of a person are you?
You married me. This is how it's
gonna be. Listen Jordan. I'm
taking custody of the kids. If you
agree to the divorce right now, I
will allow you visitation. Don't
try to fight it. It will save us
both a lot of money and I have a
feeling you're gonna need it.
Naomi exits to the dressing room. Jordan gets up, follows
after her.
I've got news for you. You're not
taking my kids.
I already spoke to my lawyer. He
said even if you don't get
convicted I can still get custody.
My lawyers are more powerful than
yours. You're not taking my kids!
You vicious cunt!
Naomi slaps Jordan. Jordan hits her back and exits.
Fuck you! You're not taking my
kids. You fucking bitch!
Jordan grabs a pair of scissors and starts slashing the
couch. He retrieves a stash of coke from the couch
lining. Naomi enters the hallway as Jordan snorts coke.
Look at yourself Jordan. You're
sick, you're a sick man.
You're not taking my kids.
You think I'd let my kids near
you? Look at you. You know what my
lawyers said? You're going to jail
for twenty years. Twenty fucking
years, Jordan. You'll be lucky if
you ever see them again.
Oh yeah? You don't think I'm gonna
see my kids again? Oh yeah?
Put her down Jordan! Put her down!
Violet, Violet! Help me! He's got
Skylar! Get the key!

Jordan's here, too, looking miserable. He stops Lucas.
Lemme just sign the fucking thing.
He signs the fucking thing.
Jordan sits alone, finishes writing a long list of names
on a yellow legal pad.
For the next six hours, I came up
with a list. Friends, enemies,
business associates, anybody who'd
ever known me or taken so much as
a stock tip. The first name on
the list was Donnie's.
And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, we're suddenly...
Talk normally, breathe normally,
within five minutes you'll forget
you even have it on.
Jordan nods, buttons up his shirt.
As Robbie and Chester Ming look on, Jordan forces a smile
as he approaches Donnie, who gives him a hug.
The trial won't be for months,
so obviously I'll be counting on
you to pick up the slack.
Whatever you need, bro. You know
that.
And you know how much that means
to me. Hey, you know what I
wanted to ask you?
Jordan catches Donnie's eye, pushes the PAPER over in
front of him.
The Steve Madden deal, did he
ever come through on that?
"DON'T INCRIMINATE YOURSELF. I'M WEARING A WIRE."
Remember he was supposed to kick
back like four mil from that one
account?
Uh... tell you the truth I was so
fucked up, I don't really remember
anything about that.You want the last
yellowtail?
Why not?
And thus began my career as a
government cooperator. I was a
rat...
But I wasn't losing any sleep
over it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan.     You got a
visitor.
I need you to get dressed.
Why? What's going on?
You're going to jail.
Donnie Azoff, my partner. My best
friend.
After months of legal wrangling,
I was finally sentenced to prison.
Jordan stands addressing his 700 Brokers. WE SEE the
eager young FACES, hanging on his every word.
I gave up everyone, and in return
got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.
Like Mad Max'd said, the
chickens'd come home to roost.
Whatever the fuck that means.
I hope your Honor would agree that
Mr. Belfort has distinguished
himself in terms of his
cooperation in this white collar
fraud. Mr. Belfort has helped the
government win convictions over
two dozen serious offenders and
helped them recover millions of
dollars to be made available for
restitution to the victims.
The sentence of the court shall be
48 months in Federal Prison.
Please remand the defendant.
Jordan's so guilty it hurts. As
Jordan is led away by GUARDS...
commuting home on the subway, like any other piker.
I'm not ashamed to admit, when we
arrived to prison, I was
absolutely terrified...
Belfort! Fuckin' move!
Jordan leaps to his feet.
I needn't have been.
A tennis ball hits pavement and WE PAN UP TO JORDAN, in
prison fatigues but playing doubles with three other
PRISONERS, all white middle-aged EXECUTIVE TYPES.
Sorry, just out. What is that,
forty-thirty?
As the game continues, Jordan serving, the CAMERA PULLS
UP TO SEE THE WHOLE PRISON YARD: one group of inmates
does Tai Chi while another has formed a book club.
For a brief, fleeting moment, I'd
forgotten I was rich and lived in
America.
BLACK OUT.
I watch him speak and what he says
is motivational about life. He
tells about life and how you can
be more rich.
He is going to teach us how to be
successful, how to set our goals.
I will build my future by using
Jordan Belfort as my mentor.
Choosing what is good from him and
being a millionaire.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join
me in welcoming to Auckland, New
Zealand... Mr. Jordan Belfort!
Sell me this pen.
Well, it's a good pen, it's a
ballpoint
Jordan takes the pen back with a smile. Hands it to the
next person.
Sell me this pen.
WE RAKE ALONGSIDE HIS AUDIENCE, transfixed, desperate for
Jordan's knowledge, desperate to be molded, to be rich...
Sell me this pen...Sell me this
pen... Sell me this pen...Sell me
this pen.
